# UKB Showcase Ontology

[UKBiobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk) (UKB) is a large scale dataset of genetic data and clinical phenotypes for ~half a million participants. It is widely used in genetic and epidemiological studies in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry. The goal of this repo is to ontologize the [Showcase](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/). It can support analytical needs that rely on the hierarchical structure of Showcase.
