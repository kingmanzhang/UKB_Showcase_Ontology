1	Population characteristics	0	1	This category contains data on some general characteristics of participants.	
2	Ongoing characteristics	0	1	This category contains data on some general characteristics of participants that were obtained or are updated on an ongoing basis following recruitment into UK Biobank.	
42	Algorithmically-defined outcomes	0	1	This category holds classification of selected health-related events, obtained through algorithmic combinations of coded information from UK Biobank's baseline assessment data collection along with linkage data, including: <ul> <li>Self-reported medical condition codes (~F20002~) reported at the baseline assessment </li> <li>Hospital admissions; diagnoses and procedures (~C2000~) </li> <li>ICD-10 codes in Death Register records (~F40001~, ~F40002~) </li> </ul> The classification is intended to help researchers to include health-related outcomes in their analyses without having to select lists of diagnostic and/or procedural codes and combine the different data sources themselves. It is based on algorithms developed by the UK Biobank outcome adjudication group, aiming to classify disease outcomes with high positive predictive value (i.e. a high probability that people classified as being positive for a health-related event have indeed experienced that event). Where possible, we provide the best available information on the estimated positive predictive value of each source or combination of sources so that researchers can use this information in their analyses - see ~R593~.

54	MET Scores	0	1	This category contains derived MET (Metabolic Equivalent Task) scores data based on IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) guidelines. Methods on how these fields were derived are described in the following OpenAccess publication that can be found in ~R3594~. <br> <br> The data was updated in June 2023 to address some differences between the original derivation and the published IPAQ guidelines (~R540~) regarding outliers and missing values. Please see ~R2401~ for details.	This data was generated as part of UKB Application ID 12184. <br>Principal Investigator: Mike Trenell, Newcastle University <br>It was updated in June 2023 to address differences regarding the treatment of outliers and missing values.
76	Indices of Multiple Deprivation	0	1	Indices of Multiple Deprivation come from a UK government qualitative study of deprived areas in British local councils. The study is conducted separately in England (IMD), Scotland (SIMD) and Wales (WIMD). Scores were gathered from open data published by the UK government.	IMD scores offer a more complex and detailed view of deprivation, based on more factors than the Townsend index (~F189~). As IMD scores are calculated in different ways between England, Scotland and Wales, the UK Biobank team did not attempt to merge them and is publishing them separately. Scores were taken as close as possible to the baseline assessment, resulting in: <p> 8 scores for England, from the 2010 edition of English IMD <br> Original data: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-indices-of-deprivation <ul> <li>Index of Multiple Deprivation</li> <li>Crime score</li> <li>Education score</li> <li>Employment score</li> <li>Health score</li> <li>Housing score</li> <li>Income score</li> <li>Living environment score</li> </ul> <p> 8 scores for Scotland, from the 2009 edition of Scottish IMD <br> Original data: http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/SIMD <ul> <li>Index of Multiple Deprivation</li> <li>Access to services score</li> <li>Crime score</li> <li>Education score</li> <li>Employment score</li> <li>Health score</li> <li>Housing score</li> <li>Income score</li> </ul> <p> 9 scores for Wales, from the 2008 edition of Welsh IMD <br> Original data: http://gov.wales/statistics-and-research/welsh-index-multiple-deprivation/?lang=en <ul> <li>Index of Multiple Deprivation</li> <li>Access to services score</li> <li>Community safety score</li> <li>Education score</li> <li>Employment score</li> <li>Health score</li> <li>Housing score</li> <li>Income score</li> <li>Physical environment score</li> </ul>
100	Brain MRI	0	1	This category groups together results from the MRI brain imaging studies performed at UK Biobank assessment centres. <p>Before selecting this data it is strongly recommended that researchers view ~R1977~. <p> An email discussion list has been setup for researchers wishing todiscuss any aspects of the UK Biobank imaging protocols, data or analysis at ~Ehttps://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=UKB-NEUROIMAGING~.	The scanner used for data capture is a standard Siemens Skyra 3T running VD13A SP4 (as of October 2015), with a standard Siemens 32-channel RF receive head coil.
101	Carotid ultrasound	0	1	Ultrasound scan of carotid artery	
102	Heart MRI	0	1	Chest MRI imaging	
103	DXA assessment	0	1	Whole body DXA imaging.	
104	ECG at rest, 12-lead	0	1	12-lead ECG	
105	Abdominal MRI	0	1	Abdominal MRI scans	
106	Task functional brain MRI	0	1	Task functional MRI (tfMRI) uses the same measurement technique as resting-state fMRI (~L111~), while the subject performs a particular task or experiences a sensory stimulus. Derived phenotypic fields relate to the strength of response to the specific task (or a specific component of a more complex cognitive process) within a given anatomical brain region. The task used in Biobank was chosen to engage a range of high-level cognitive systems. <p> The task is the Hariri faces/shapes "emotion" task [Hariri et al., 2002, Barch et al., 2013], as implemented in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), but with shorter overall duration and hence fewer total stimulus block repeats. The participants are presented with blocks of trials and asked to decide either which of two faces presented on the bottom of the screen match the face at the top of the screen, or which of two shapes presented at the bottom of the screen match the shape at the top of the screen. The faces have either angry or fearful expressions. The ePrime script that controls the video presented to the participant is derived from the one used by the HCP, and is available under the Resources tab.	
107	Diffusion brain MRI	0	1	Diffusion-weighted imaging is a structural technique that measures the ability of water molecules to move within their local tissue environment. Water diffusion is measured along a range of orientations, providing two types of derived phenotype variables. Local (voxel-wise) estimates of diffusion properties reflect the integrity of microstructural tissue compartments (e.g., diffusion tensor estimates). Long-range estimates based on tract-tracing (tractography) reflect structural connectivity between pairs of brain regions.	
109	Susceptibility weighted brain MRI	0	1	Susceptibility-weighted imaging is a structural technique that is sensitive to magnetized tissue constituents (magnetic susceptibility). Data from one scan (including phase and magnitude images from two echo times) can be processed in multiple ways to reflect venous vasculature, microbleeds or aspects of microstructure (e.g., iron, calcium and myelin).	
110	T1 structural brain MRI	0	1	T1-weighted imaging is a structural technique with high-resolution depiction of brain anatomy, having strong contrast between grey and white matter, reflecting differences in the interaction of water with surrounding tissues (tissue T1 relaxation times). This modality provides derived fields primarily relating to volumes of brain tissues and structures. It is also critical for calculations of cross-subject and cross-modality alignments, needed in order to process all other brain modalities.	
111	Resting functional brain MRI	0	1	Resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) measures changes in blood oxygenation associated with intrinsic brain activity (i.e., in the absence of an explicit task or sensory stimulus). Derived phenotypic fields estimate the apparent connectivity between pairs of brain regions, as reflected in the presence of spontaneous co-fluctuations in signal (i.e., the appearance of a connection based on co-activity, as opposed to a structural tract from dMRI).	
112	T2-weighted brain MRI	0	1	T2-weighted imaging is a structural technique with contrast dominated by signal decay from interactions between water molecules (T2 relaxation times). Image intensity is primarily related to pathology, with relatively subtle signal differences between grey and white matter. T2-weighted images depict alterations to tissue compartments typically associated with pathology (e.g., white matter lesions). <p> After early piloting, a standard T2/PD-weighted acquisition was dropped due to a combination of factors such as overall value and timing practicalities.	This category primarily refers to the T2 FLAIR structural scan. <p> The T2/PD scan was originally tentatively included as a standard protocol in diagnostic imaging for the detection of some pathologies. Consultation with research experts concluded it has little or no value to the research questions UK Biobank is likely to investigate. Further, the b=0 dMRI scans can to some extent be used as a surrogate for this. Hence in the face of overall scan time pressure, the T2/PD scan was dropped from the protocol during the pilot.
113	Local environment	0	1	Properties of the local environment around participants.	
114	Residential air pollution	0	1	This category contains data on local environmental exposures, conducted by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (http://www.sahsu.org/) as part of the BioSHaRE-EU Environmental Determinants of Health Project (http://www.bioshare.eu/). The aim of the BioSHaRE-EU Environmental Determinants of Health Project is to harmonize environmental exposures from multiple biobanks in different countries. UK Biobank is a participating biobank in this project. <p> Air pollution estimates for the year 2010 were modelled for each address using a Land Use Regression (LUR) model developed as part of the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE, http://www.escapeproject.eu/), funded under the EU 7th Framework Programme (for references see below). The LUR model is based on ESCAPE monitoring done between 26 January 2010 - 18 January 2011, and air pollution estimates are representative for the year 2010. Traffic variables were calculated during the course of LUR based on Eurostreets (vs 3.1) digital road network for the year 2008. <p> Please note that the ESCAPE estimates for particulates are valid up to 400km from the monitoring area, which was in Greater London, but it is unclear how good the estimates are outside this area. All addresses which are more than 400km away from Greater London are not assigned PM10, PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance and PM coarse concentrations and have missing data instead (number of records: 33,935). For more information on the individual models please see the ESCAPE project website: http://www.escapeproject.eu. <p> Air pollution estimates for the years 2005-2007 were derived from EU-wide air pollution maps (resolution 100 metre x 100 metre). The x,y-coordinates of UK Biobank participants were overlaid with these maps (projected to British National Grid) and the corresponding air pollution concentration of the 100 metre x 100 metre grid cell were assigned to the coordinate. EU-wide air pollution maps were modelled based on a LUR model for Europe which also includes satellite derived air pollution estimates to improve the model performance. For details of the model and model performance see: Vienneau D, de Hoogh K, Bechle MJ, Beelen R, van Donkelaar A, Martin RV, Millet DB, Hoek G, Marshall JD. 2013. Western European land use regression incorporating satellite- and ground-based measurements of NO2 and PM10. Environmental Science and Technology 47(23): 13555-13564. <p style="color:red;font-size:120%;"> <b>Please note that estimates from different air pollution models (ESCAPE [2010] and EU-wide [2005-2007]) were not designed to be combined and should not be averaged, as this may introduce bias.</b>	
115	Residential noise pollution	0	1	This category contains data on local environmental exposures, conducted by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (http://www.sahsu.org/) as part of the BioSHaRE-EU Environmental Determinants of Health Project (http://www.bioshare.eu/). The aim of the BioSHaRE-EU Environmental Determinants of Health Project is to harmonize environmental exposures from multiple biobanks in different countries. UK Biobank is a participating Biobank in this project <p> Noise estimates for the year 2009 were modelled using a version of the CNOSSOS-EU noise model. These Common NOise aSSessment methOdS (CNOSSOS) are recommended by the European Noise Directive 2002/49/EC. <p> Noise pollution estimates for the year 2010 were modelled for each address using a Land Use Regression (LUR) model developed as part of the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) (http://www.escapeproject.eu/), funded under the EU 7th Framework Programme (for references see below). The LUR model is based on ESCAPE monitoring done between 26 January 2010 - 18 January 2011, and air pollution estimates are representative for the year 2010. Traffic variables were calculated during the course of LUR based on Eurostreets (vs 3.1) digital road network for the year 2008.	
116	Cognitive function online	0	1	Several of the cognitive function tests administered via touchscreen during the initial assessment visit were re-implemented as web-based questionnaires and participants were invited to complete them remotely. Two additional tests were also included in the 2014 iteration, the order of running being: <ol> <li>Device and Mood</li> <li>Fluid intelligence</li> <li>Trail making</li> <li>Symbol digit substitution</li> <li>Pairs matching</li> <li>Numeric memory</li> </ol> <p> The exercise was repeated in 2021 with Pairs matching and Numeric memory replaced by Matrix completion. <p> Because it was possible to complete the modules over a number of sessions the Device/Mood questions were asked at the beginning of each online session. Hence some people will have multiple sets of answers for Device/Mood and these can be related to their answer to the other modules by comparing their entry timestamps. <p> A reaction time test was also performed in 2014 however the results were felt to be of insufficient quality to present due to inconsistencies in the timing routines of the various browsers and devices used by participants to perform the test.	
117	Pairs matching	0	1	This category contains data on 'pairs' matching tests. Participants are asked to memorise the position of as many matching pairs of cards as possible. The cards are then turned face down on the screen and the participant is asked to touch as many pairs as possible in the fewest tries. <p> Either two or three rounds were conducted. The first round used 3 pairs of cards, the second 6 pairs of cards and the third 8 pairs of cards. Participants were only presented with the third round if they made 0 or 1 errors on the second round. <p> For non-specialists, the primary item of interest is likely to be ~F20132~. <p> This measure was also performed in clinics using a touchscreen in ~L100030~.	
118	Fluid intelligence / reasoning	0	1	This category contains data on questions designed to assess 'Fluid intelligence' (i.e. the capacity to solve problems that require logic and reasoning ability, independent of acquired knowledge). The participant has 2 minutes to complete as many questions as possible from the test. <p> For non-specialists, the primary item of interest is ~F20191~. <p> This measure was also performed in clinics using a touchscreen in ~L100027~. <p>Between the 2014 and 2021 iterations, options to respond "Don't know" and "Prefer not to answer" were added to the online version to brinng it into line with the touchscreen implementation. An additional option for two of the questions in the 2014 version were removed in 2021 to bring then into line with the clinic version - see the Notes for ~F20171~ and ~F20189~ for specific details. <p>For instance 0, answer and duration data is provided for all questions up to and including the question being presented at the 2-minute limit. For instance 1, answer and duration data is provided only for questions answered before the 2-minute limit. For both instances, only questions attempted within the allotted 2-minute limit are included in ~F20191~ and ~F20192~ (the fluid intelligence score and the number of fluid intelligence questions attempted within time limit).	
119	Arterial spin labelling brain MRI	0	1	Arterial spin labelling brain MRI	
120	Numeric memory	0	1	This category contains data on a test designed to assess numeric short-term memory, as part of the touchscreen questionnaire. The participant was shown a 2-digit number to remember. The number then disappeared and after a short while they were asked to enter the number onto the screen. The number became one digit longer each time they remembered correctly (up to a maximum of 12 digits). Data collected include the number of digits and value of the number, the length of time the number was displayed, the time that the participant first entered and last entered a digit, the time taken to complete the test, the value of the number entered by the participant, whether or not the participant was correct, the maximum number of digits remembered, and whether the test was completed. This test is available for a subset of participants. <p> This measure was also performed in clinics using a touchscreen in ~L100029~.	
121	Trail making	0	1	Participants were presented with a series of labelled circles and instructed to touch them according to a particular ordering rule. <p> Note that all results begin at the second item in each trail since the test is initiated by the participant correctly clicking on the first item at which point the timer is started. <p> This measure was also performed in clinics using a touchscreen in ~L505~.	
122	Symbol digit substitution	0	1	Participants were presented with a series of grids in which symbols were to be matched to numbers according to a key presented on the screen. <p> This measure was also performed in clinics using a touchscreen in ~L502~.	The values for ~F20198~, ~F20200~, ~F20229~ and ~F20230~ must be considered together as the corresponding entries in them relate to the same challenge/response pair. <p> Because of the open-ended nature of the test it was possible to score quite well on the count of correctly matched symbols by very rapidly entering arbitrary selections to accumulate random matches. When assessing performance the value of ~F20159~ should therefore be used in conjunction with ~F20195~ to identify instances of this strategy.
123	Work environment	0	1	This category contains the result for the online Healthy Work questionnaire conducted from June through September 2015.	
124	Body composition by DXA	0	1	Body composition results derived from DXA measurements in UK Biobank assessment centre.	
125	Bone size, mineral and density by DXA	0	1	Bone composition results derived from DXA measurements in UK Biobank assessment centre.	
126	Liver MRI	0	1	Liver MRI images and derived data. <br> <br>The derived fields in this category were supplied by Perspectum (application #9914). See the following publications for details about the methods used to derive the data: <br> <br>Wilman HR, Kelly M, Garratt S, et al. (2017) Characterisation of liver fat in the UK Biobank cohort. PLoS ONE 12(2): e0172921. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0172921 <br> <br>Mojtahed A, Kelly CJ, Herlihy AH, et al.

Abdom Radiol (NY). 44(1):72-84. doi: 10.1007/s00261-018-1701-2	
127	Process authorisation	0	1	Indicates the member of staff who signed-off various stages/operations within the UK Biobank Assessment centres to confirm that they are a valid and correct record of what had taken place.	The original staff usernames have been replaced by arbitrary numeric IDs to preserve confidentiality. <p> Note that (with the exception of Welcome and Consent) not all participants completed every stage and process. The absence of a record here indicates that the participant did not complete the corresponding stage/process.
128	Pulse wave analysis	0	1	Pulse wave analysis and blood pressure measurement was carried out using a vicorder instrument during the heart MRI scan. <br><br> Blood pressure measures acquired with the vicorder instrument should be used in collaboration with the Aortic Distensibility Magnetic Resonance images as these were acquired during the MRI scan in the supine position. Other interests in blood pressure should rely on measures available in Category 100011, which were acquired using the Omron Digital blood pressure monitor in the seated position in the clinic.	
129	Process completion times	0	1	Times when sections within the Assessment Centre were completed (i.e. signed-off by an appropriately qualified member of UK Biobank staff).	Note that (with the exception of Welcome and Consent) not all participants completed every stage and process. The absence of a record here indicates that the participant did not complete the corresponding stage/process.
130	Employment history	0	1	Participants were asked to enumerate their work history. Periods of 6 months or longer during which they were in paid full time employment for at least 15 hours each week have been labelled "jobs", with all other periods labelled "gaps". <p> Additional information about employment at the time of visiting a UK Biobank clinic is presented in ~L100064~.

148	Urine processing	0	1	Urine processing metrics.	
149	Abdominal composition	0	1	This category contains derived data from the abdominal MRI, which were supplied by AMRA&reg; Medical AB (Link&ouml;ping, Sweden). <br> <br> Image-derived phenotypes relating to liver iron and fat, and abdominal composition have been generated by multiple institutes. The data from these other institutes are held in ~L126~ and ~L158~. Meaningful differences may exist between data across these categories and therefore, data should not be merged without very careful consideration. <br> <br> Two highly comparable, but distinct pipelines have been used to generate the derived data in this category. Data for participants with only instance 2 have been generated using one pipeline (pipeline version 1). For those with data at both instance 2 and 3, data from instance 2 have been reanalysed in connection with analysis of the corresponding data from instance 3 to enable the highest possible precision for longitudinal assessment (pipeline version 2). A list of the participants with data at both instance 2 and 3, analysed with pipeline version 2, can currently be found in ~F41000~. <br> <br> The following OpenAccess publications provide details of the methods used to derive data in this category under pipeline version 1: <ul> <li> Karlsson A, Rosander J, Romu T, et al.

150	Home locations	0	1	This section holds information on the geographical location of the home addresses of participants over time. The coordinates presented were derived from UK address information obtained from a variety of sources, including self-report by participants. There is now an updated set of location history fields (~F32220~ - ~F32224~). These have been derived to correct errors in the older set of location history fields (~F22700~ - ~F22704~), which are now marked "[obsolete]" and will be retired in a subsequent update. Researchers are advised to adapt their pipelines to use the new fields where possible. <p> The older fields contained some inherent inaccuracies in that some of the addresses were likely to reflect locations where the NHS interacted with the participant rather than their residential address, and that the date of address change corresponded to the date the address was changed in the corresponding IT system, rather than the actual address change. The latter issue largely arises from delays in participants informing UK Biobank or external agencies that they have moved. In addition, however, we have identified a number of dates that were incorrectly processed in the construction of ~F22700~ and which were up to 30 months different from the participant's change of address notification. <p> NHS-source data has been removed from the new set of fields, except where the accuracy of the location data could be cross-checked with another data source such as self-report. For this reason, ~F22700~ - ~F22704~ contain no location history data prior to baseline. The dates have also been corrected as far as possible, though they will still reflect when participants registered address changes rather than the actual date when they moved. Please also note that absence of information after recruitment does not necessarily mean that a particular participant has not changed address, only that they have not registered the change. <p> All home location fields in this category are restricted. If you require any location data for your project, you must contact the Access Management team for permission, listing the specific fields you require. Please note that access will only be granted for the lowest resolution fields necessary to complete your project. Access to higher-resolution fields will only be granted in exceptional circumstances where they are deemed essential for a particular research question.	
151	Greenspace and coastal proximity	0	1	This category contains environmental indicators relating to greenspace exposure and distance to the coast that was attributed to participants based on home location grid references. The data linkage was undertaken by the European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School. The available metrics include: <ul> <li>Greenspace estimates (at 1000m and 300m home location buffers);</li> <li>Land coverage estimates (for domestic gardens and water) (at 1000m and 300m home location buffers);</li> <li>Land coverage estimates for the 'natural environment' compared to the 'built environment' (at 1000m and 300m home location buffers);</li> <li>Distance from home location to the coast.</li> </ul> The location used for each measurement was the participant's home at the time they were assessed in a UK Biobank centre. The date of the assessment visit is indicated in ~F53~.	There is evidence to suggest that where one lives can influence mental and physical health. Application 15374 focussed on analysis of mental health, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and physical activity. The aim was to understand the factors that mediate the relationship between the natural environment surrounding an individual and their physical and mental health. More specifically, the research sought to investigate associations between the environmental characteristics of participants' place of birth and current home location, and health outcomes (e.g. mental health and wellbeing, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and physical activity), with a focus on the questions: <ul> <li>Do individuals living in closer proximity to greenspace or blue space participate in more physical activity?</li> <li>Does proximity to greenspace or blue space influence mental health and wellbeing? Does physical activity mediate this?</li> <li>Are there associations between participants' place of birth and/or current living environment, and physical disease (specifically cardiovascular disease and diabetes)?</li> </ul> The Principal investigator was Dr Benedict Wheeler of the University of Exeter. <p> Note that some participants only have data available for one instance. The completeness of data across these fields is determined by the participant's country of residence since data-fields 24500-24505 are available for England only.
152	Process durations	0	1	To help UK Biobank optimise the use of equipment and staff time, many of the processes which occurred within the Assessment Centres were timed.	
153	Digestive health	0	1	Results of the on-line gastro-intestinal health self-assessment questionnaire issued in 2017.	
154	Experience of pain	0	1	Results for the "experience of pain" self-assessment questionnaire issued in 2019.	
155	Mood	0	1	This category contains questions on the mood of participants prior to completing the online cognitive questionnaire. Each question began "Over the last week have you:" <p> Because it was possible to complete the modules over a number of sessions the Device/Mood questions were asked at the beginning of each online session. Hence some people will have multiple sets of answers for Device/Mood and these can be related to their answer to the other modules by comparing their entry timestamps.

158	Abdominal organ composition	0	1	This category contains derived data from the abdominal MRI, which were supplied by Calico (Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, USA) and the University of Westminster, as described in ~P4891~ and ~P7129~. <br> <br> Image-derived phenotypes relating to liver iron and fat, and abdominal composition have been generated by multiple institutes. The data from these other institutes are held in ~L126~ and ~L149~. Meaningful differences may exist between data across these categories and therefore, data should not be merged without very careful consideration. <br> <br> Derived-data were estimated using 1 of 3 pipelines. Across the fields in this category, a single participant may have data generated by more than one pipeline. The QC ~F21094~ indicates, for each participant, the data fields associated with each pipeline. The notes section and array indices of the QC field should be noted for details of each pipeline.

163	Neurobiomarkers	0	1	EDTA plasma samples, collected during UK Biobank imaging assessment, were sent to University College London UKDRI Fluid Biomarker Lab for assay in association with Project 76059. <br><br>Each plasma sample was measured in singlicates for Quanterix Simoa Neurology 4-plex E (AB40, AB42, GFAP, NF-light) and Quanterix Simoa pTau-181V2 using Quanterix Simoa HD-X Analyzer. <br><br>The processed samples originated from participants engaged in the UK Biobank COVID-19 re-imaging study. <br>For details of the COVID-19 re-imaging study and the matched case-control features of this sub-section of the cohort, please see ~R2120~ and ~F41000~.	
164	Entry method	0	1	Participants were asked to record the system/technology they used to perform the cognitive tests. This was done to allow analyses to allow for possible effects due to differences therein, for example a difference in input speed between keyboard and touchscreen.	
170	Exome sequences	0	1	The first tranche of UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) was made available for 50,000 UK Biobank participants in March 2019, and the data for an additional 150,000 participants was made available in October 2020. Initially data was computed using two protocols, FE and SPB, however these were replaced by a new improved unified OQFE pipeline when the additional 150,000 sequences were released (with the earlier values being reprocessed to match this). <p> Fields 23141-23146 will eventually contain information on all the participants for whom exome sequencing is possible. It will only be possible to access the data for these fields in-situ via UK Biobank's Research Access Platform.	The first 50k release prioritized individuals with whole body MRI imaging data, enhanced baseline measurements, hospital episode statistics (HES), and/or linked primary care records. Additionally, one disease area was selected for enrichment: individuals with admission to hospital with a primary diagnosis of asthma (ICD10 J45 or J46). With the addition of the additional 150k samples, the 200k release includes 1,135 parent-offspring pairs, 3,855 full-sibling pairs, including 101 trios, 27 monozygotic twin pair and 7,461 second degree genetically determined relationships. <p> Exomes were captured with the IDT xGen Exome Research Panel v1.0 including supplemental probes. The basic design targets 39 Mbp of the human genome (19,396 genes). Multiplexed samples were sequenced with dual-indexed 75x75 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using S2 (initial 50k release) and S4 flow cells (all subsequent samples). A different IDT v1.0 oligo lot was used in the initial 50k sequencing than was used in the sequencing of all subsequent samples. Inclusion of this information as a covariate in downstream analyses is recommended. In each sample and among targeted bases, coverage exceeds 20X at 95.2% of sites on average. Complete sequencing protocols are described in detail by the summary manuscript (~Ehttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33087929/~). <p> Primary and secondary analysis for the UKB 200k release was performed with an updated Functional Equivalence (FE) protocol that retains original quality scores in the CRAM files (referred to as the OQFE protocol, ~Ehttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.02.20222232v1~). The OQFE protocol aligns and duplicate-marks all raw sequencing data (FASTQs) to the full GRCh38 reference in an alt-aware manner as described in the original FE manuscript (~Ehttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30279509/~). The OQFE CRAMs were then called for small variants with DeepVariant to generate per-sample gVCFs. These gVCFs were aggregated and joint-genotyped with GLnexus (~Ehttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/572347v1~) to create a single multi-sample VCF (pVCF) for all UKB 200k samples. PLINK files were derived directly from this pVCF. Please note: to ensure that the UKB 200k data supports a broad range of analyses, no variant- or sample-level filters were pre-applied to the pVCF or PLINK files. The publicly released pVCF is the direct output of GLnexus, from which the PLINK files are generated. The pVCF contains allele-read depths and genotype qualities for all genotypes from which variant- and sample-level QC metrics can be calculated and to which analysis-specific filters can be applied. Examples of such filtering are described in the UKB 200K preprint (~Ehttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.02.20222232v1~). <p> Please note that the OQFE protocol differs from both previous UKB 50k releases, SPB and FE, which are described below for reference. All UKB 200k samples were processed from FASTQ with the OQFE docker (~Ehttps://hub.docker.com/r/dnanexus/oqfe~). Further details are provided in the WES FAQ at ~Ehttps://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/media/cfulxh52/uk-biobank-exome-release-faq_v9-december-2020.pdf~ <p> In the original protocol, the SPB pipeline first converted all raw sequencing data to FASTQs according to Illumina NovaSeq best practices and aligned those reads to the GRCh38 reference genome with BWA-mem to generate a CRAM file for each sample. After read-duplicate marking, SNVs and indels were called for with WeCall (GenomicsPLC), generating a gVCF per sample. These gVCFs were joint genotyped using GLnexus (~Ehttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/572347v1~) to create a single, unfiltered project-level VCF (pVCF). Genotype depth filters (SNV DP&ge;7, indel DP&ge;10) were applied prior to variant site filters requiring at least one variant genotype passing an allele balance filter (heterozygous SNV AB>0.15, heterozygous indel<0.20), resulting in a second 'filtered' pVCF. <p> To maximize data utility and ease of use, an additional "Functionally Equivalent" (FE) pVCF was generated from FASTQs, following the primary analysis protocol described in the 2018 manuscript (PMID: 30279509) and then subject to GATK 3.0 variant calling and hard filtering of variants with inbreeding coefficient<-0.03 or without at least one variant genotype of DP&ge;10, GQ&ge;20 and, if heterozygous, AB&ge;0.20.

263	Genotypes	0	1	Genome-wide genetic data is available for 488,000 UK Biobank participants. <p> Genotype calling was performed by Affymetrix (now part of ThermoFisher Scientific) on two closely related purpose-designed arrays. ~50,000 participants were run on the UK BiLEVE Axiom array (~R149600~) and the remaining ~450,000 were run on the UK Biobank Axiom array (~R149601~). The dataset combines results from both arrays (see ~F22000~) and there are 805,426 markers in the released genotype data. The positions of markers in the data are in GRCh37 coordinates. It was not possible to assay genotypes for some participants (~3%) as sufficient DNA could not be extracted from their blood samples. <p> The genotype data were quality controlled (QC). In addition the dataset was phased and ~96M genotypes were imputed using computationally efficient methods combined with the Haplotype Reference Consortium and UK10K haplotype resources. Classical allelic variations at eleven HLA genes were imputed. Information from the QC pipeline, such as array, and important genetic properties of the data such as population structure and relatedness are available. <p>Details of these analyses, and the methods used to derive other data such as imputation and haplotypes, is given in: <br> Bycroft et al, "The UK Biobank resource with deep phenotyping and genomic data", <a class="basic" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0579-z">Nature, 562, pp 203-209 (2018)</a>, which Researchers using this data are asked to cite (~R530~). <p> The types of genetic data available are <ul> <li>Genotypes</li> <li>SNP and Sample QC information</li> <li>Imputed Genotypes</li> <li>Phased haplotypes</li> <li>Imputed classical HLA types</li> <li>Genotype intensities</li> <li>Genotype confidences</li> <li>Genotype SNP-posteriors</li> <li>Genotype B-allele-frequency and Log2Ratio</li> <li>Array definition files</li> </ul> <p>Please note that most of the fields in ~L100315~, ~L100319~ and ~L100035~ are indicators showing the availability of data.

603	Water minerals	0	1	Water hardness classifications are provided based on United States Geological Survey and World Health Organization definitions of domestic water calcium carbonate concentration. The results were obtained from freedom of information requests to local water supply companies across England, Scotland, and Wales. Postcodes were assigned to participant-visit instances based on approximate location (rounded to nearest km) and the assigned postcodes were used as a link to surveyed locations. <p> Data for baseline visits were derived from survey results for 2005. Data for repeat assessment and imaging visits were derived from survey results from 2013. The survey year for a particular result has been provided as a separate instanced data field, and can be used as an additional QC variable. <p> For measures relating to non-baseline visits - First repeat assessment visit (2012-13), or Imaging visit (2014+) - in most cases the address used to map to the water hardness surveys was from a single visit (either instance 1, or instance 2). For approximately 5,900 cases where a partipant had both instance 1 and instance 2 visits, and additionally did not move address between these visits, the results have been assigned to their repeat assessment visit (instance 1). <p> Data in this category were provided by the University of Melbourne.

996	GP records for Covid Research	0	1	The items within this category were made available as a temporary measure, under the Government's Control of Patient Information (COPI) notice, to assist researchers who were engaged in work related to COVID-19. The COPI notice has since expired; no further primary care data will be received by UK Biobank for the specific purpose of COVID-19 research, and these data can no longer be requested or downloaded by researchers.	
997	Coronavirus infection study	0	1	This study aimed to enable research into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on subsequent health outcomes (i.e. 'long COVID'). <p> The UK Biobank self-test antibody study (see ~L998~) used antibody lateral flow tests (LFTs) for home testing which did not distinguish between antibodies produced following infection and those produced following vaccination. In order to identify those vaccinated individuals with a positive LFT result who have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, laboratory assay of specific (i.e. nucleocapsid) antibodies was required. Unlike spike antibodies that are produced following both infection and vaccination (and which the LFT detects), nucleocapsid antibodies are only produced in response to infection. This follow-on study therefore involved asking consented eligible participants to collect a capillary blood sample and post it to a laboratory for analysis. <p> For more detailed information see ~R4600~ for the Overview document describing the coronavirus infection study.

2000	Hospital inpatient	0	1	This category contains data on hospital inpatient admissions, obtained through linkage to external data providers. Inpatients are defined as persons who are admitted to hospital and occupy a hospital bed. This includes both admissions where an overnight stay is planned and day cases. <br> <p>Hospital inpatient data are available to researchers in two formats: summary and record-level. Detailed explanations of the how the data was collected and the data formats available can be found in the Resources tab below, in particular in the overview of the Inpatient data (~R138483~) and the Hospital Inpatient Data Dictionary (~R141140~). <br> <br> <br> <b>Summary fields - Diagnoses & Operations</b> <br> <p>UK Biobank has created summary fields based on the record-level data that provide the first date of any given diagnosis or operation code appearing in each participant's inpatient record. <p>For diagnoses, there are separate fields for each of ICD-9 & ICD-10 and for both the main diagnosis position and for either main or secondary position. (See ~L2002~ below.) <p>There are similar fields for operations/procedures, for each of OPCS-3 and OPCS-4, both for the main procedure position or any position in the data. (See ~L2005~ below.) <p>For projects needing only information about diagnoses and operations/procedures and their first known occurrence dates these Summary fields should be sufficient and are simpler to work with than the record-level data. <br> <br> <br> <b>Other Summary fields</b> <br> <p>There are also other summary fields relating to administration, maternity and psychiatry (~L2001~, ~L2003~ and ~L2004~ respectively) with each summary field providing an overview of the amount and type of data stored across all inpatient records for that data field for each participant. <p>These summary fields are not, of themselves, particularly useful for research purposes, but are provided to illustrate the quantity and type of data available in the corresponding record-level tables via the Data Portal. <br> <br> <br> <b>Record-level inpatient data</b> <br> <p>A rawer form of the data is available, which consists of seven interrelated database tables: HESIN, HESIN_DIAG, HESIN_OPER, HESIN_CRITICAL, HESIN_PSYCH, HESIN_MATERNITY and HESIN_DELIVERY. These are explained in detail in the overview of the Inpatient data (~R138483~) and the Hospital Inpatient Data Dictionary (~R141140~) below. <p>Due to its size and complexity the record-level inpatient data is accessed via the online Data Portal (via a project's Download page). Access is granted to each table by adding the appropriate field from ~L2006~ to a researcher basket. <br> <br> <p><i>Researcher publications should use the following citation where data from NHS England has been used: "This work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of their care and support." </i>	This data is large and complex and we advise you to read the explanatory documentation provided in the Additional Resources tab for details on how these data are presented and made accessible. <p> Information about the temporal coverage of the in-patient data from each data provider, along with suggested censoring dates can be found on the ~XData_providers_and_dates~Data Providers and Dates~ page.
2001	Summary Administration	0	1	This category contains summary fields relating to hospital admissions and discharges, including dates and other administrative aspects of the admission. Each data-field lists for each participant all the distinct values for that data-field in the hospital inpatient data. <p>These fields are supplied as part of a main UK Biobank dataset. <p>To conduct detailed analyses of these aspects of the hospital inpatient data, researchers will require access to the record-level data in ~L2006~.	
2002	Summary Diagnoses	0	1	This category contains summary fields relating to diagnoses made during hospital inpatient admissions. The diagnosis data-fields list, for each participant, all the distinct values for that data-field in the inpatient data, including main and secondary diagnoses, coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 & ICD-10). <p> Most data-fields in this category have a corresponding field showing the date each diagnosis code was first recorded in the inpatient data. The date given is the episode start date (the EPISTART field on the HESIN table) or, if this was missing, the admission date (the ADMIDATE field on the HESIN table). <p>These fields are supplied as part of a main UK Biobank dataset. <p>See the Hospital Inpatient Data Dictionary (~R141140~) for further information about these fields and the record-level tables from which they are derived.	
2003	Summary Maternity	0	1	This category contains summary fields relating to maternity-related admissions. Each data-field lists for each participant all the distinct values for that data-field in the inpatient data. Fields in this category are only available for inpatient admissions in England. <p>These fields are supplied as part of a main UK Biobank dataset. <p>To conduct detailed analyses of these aspects of the hospital inpatient data, researchers will require access to the record-level data in ~L2006~.	
2004	Summary Psychiatric	0	1	This category contains summary fields relating to psychiatric admissions. Each data-field lists for each participant all the distinct values for that data-field in the inpatient data. Fields in this category are only available for inpatient admissions in England and Scotland. <p>These fields are supplied as part of a main UK Biobank dataset. <p>To conduct detailed analyses of these aspects of the hospital inpatient data, researchers will require access to the record-level data in ~L2006~.	
2005	Summary Operations	0	1	This category contains summary fields relating to operations and procedures performed during hospital inpatient admissions. The operations/procedures data-fields list for each participant all the distinct values for that data-field in the inpatient data coded according to the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures (OPCS-3 & OPCS-4). <p>Most data-fields in this category have a corresponding field showing the date each code was first recorded in the inpatient data. Please note that we have opted to populate this data-field with the episode start date (EPISTART in the HESIN table) or, if that was missing, the admission start date (ADMIDATE in the HESIN table) rather than use the operation date (OPDATE in the HESIN_OPER table). The rationale for this was: <ul> <li>around 1 in 5 primary procedures lacked a corresponding value for OPDATE in HESIN_OPER;</li> <br> <li>some recorded OPDATEs were inconsistent with the other date fields such as EPISTART, ADMIDATE, EPIEND and DISDATE (most likely due to data entry errors);</li> <br> <li>for those episodes with a value for OPDATE recorded the majority were the same as the value of EPISTART, with around 99% of OPDATE values within 7 days of the value of EPISTART;</li> <br> <li>values of EPISTART/ADMIDATE are more complete and thus may provide greater consistency across data providers.</li> </ul> <p>These fields are supplied as part of a main UK Biobank dataset. <p>See the Operations tab of the Hospital Inpatient Data Dictionary (~R141140~) for further information about these fields.	
2006	Record-level access	0	1	The record-level hospital inpatient data consists of seven interrelated database tables: HESIN, HESIN_DIAG, HESIN_OPER, HESIN_CRITICAL, HESIN_PSYCH, HESIN_MATERNITY and HESIN_DELIVERY. These are explained in detail in the overview of the Inpatient data (~R138483~) and the Hospital Inpatient Data Dictionary (~R141140~) located in the Resources tab of ~L2000~. <p>Due to its size and complexity the record-level inpatient data is accessed via the online Data Portal (via a project's Download page). Access is granted on a table-by-table basis. To gain access to a record-level table, add the relevant field to a basket and access will be granted when the data release is approved. For example, adding ~F41259~ (Records in HES inpatient main dataset) to a researcher basket will provide access to the table HESIN (the main table regarding inpatient admissions). <p>Fields from within this category will also appear in the standard UK Biobank dataset, however these will simply consist of counts of the number of rows within the relevant table for each participant.	
2384	XNAT image package	0	99	XNAT (http://www.xnat.org) is a user-friendly management tool designed to facilitate access to, and analysis of, images and associated phenotype data. <p> A bespoke customised version has been developed by DPUK which includes an adapter for accessing images stored in the UK Biobank image store. This tool provides an intuitive user interface to access and to develop and run analysis pipelines against the image data available at UK Biobank (subject to user being an approved UK Biobank Applicant). Access to the XNAT Data Management tool (which is not part of UK Biobank) can be requested via the URL https://ukbiobank.dpuk.org/ <p> This category groups together a set of demographics and image fields that are a pre-requisite when using the XNAT data management tool. <p>Note that ~F20216~ (T1 structural brain images - DICOM) is suitable for XNAT also, but due to the ~Hsensitive~sensitive~ nature of this field it will only be supplied to researchers when absolutely necessary and is therefore not included in this category (it can however be requested if appropriate justification is given). The NIFTI alternative ~F20252~ is however included.

100000	Assessment centre	0	1	This category contains information that was collected at the Assessment Centre, and is divided into sub-categories based on the type of assessment that was performed (i.e. touchscreen, verbal interview, physical measures, biological sampling).	
100001	Biological sampling	0	1	This category contains information on whether the biological sample was taken during at Assessment Centre, and is subdivided into categories based on the type of biological sample. Data on the amount of biological material available and their assay results can be found in categories of 'Sample Inventory' and 'Assay Results', respectively.	
100002	Blood sample collection	0	1	This category contains data on whether blood samples were taken at the Assessment Centre and if not, the reason why not, and fasting time before sample collection.	
100003	Imaging	0	1	This category contains information from imaging measurements done at the Assessment Centre and is divided into sub-categories based on the type of measure performed. <p>All Covid19 repeat imaging data is released under instance 3.	
100004	Procedural metrics	0	1	This category contains information related to the Assessment Centre systems and procedures.	
100005	Pilot assessment	0	99	The first Assessment Centre opened by UK Biobank (Cheadle, 2006) is known as the Pilot centre. The results from it were used to refine the design of the questionnaires and measurement techniques for the subsequent centres. As a consequence of this refinement process some of the questions and tests used in the Pilot were superceded and do not appear in the results from the later centres. Approximately 3600 people attended the Pilot centre.	
100006	Physical measures	0	1	This category contains information from physical measurements done at the Assessment Centre and is divided into sub-categories based on the type of physical measure performed.	
100007	Arterial stiffness	0	1	This category contains data on arterial stiffness (vascular reactivity) using the pulse waveform obtained at the finger with an infra-red sensor (PulseTrace PCA2, CareFusion, USA). The shape of the volume waveform in the finger is directly related to the time it takes for the pulse waves to travel through the arterial tree in the lower body, and to be reflected back to the finger. The time between peaks of the waveform (the peak-to-peak time; PPT) is divided into the person's height to obtain the Stiffness Index (SI). Blood pressure was also recorded. Measurement is made by clipping the device to a finger; the reading is made over 10-15 seconds. These measures were introduced to the Assessment Centre towards the end of recruitment.	
100008	Anthropometry	0	1	This category contains information on the type of body composition measures that were performed, including manual body measures (i.e. waist and hip circumference, height), and whole-body bioimpedance measures (giving segmental estimates of fat percentage, fat mass, fat-free mass and predicted muscle mass).	
100009	Body composition by impedance	0	1	This category contains data on whole-body bio-impedance measures using the Tanita BC418MA body composition analyser (i.e. basal metabolic rate, body type, weight, body fat mass, body fat percentage, fat free mass, water mass, predicted muscle mass and impedance for the right arm, right leg, left arm, left leg and trunk).	
100010	Body size measures	0	1	This category contains data on body composition measures that were taken manually (i.e. standing/sitting height, waist/hip circumference, weight, body mass index, reason for skipping these measurements, if applicable).	
100011	Blood pressure	0	1	This category contains information on blood pressure measurements and pulse rate using the Omron Digital blood pressure monitor. Two blood pressure measurements were performed on each individual, using automated (the default option) or manual devices.	
100012	ECG during exercise	0	1	This category contains data on cardio-respiratory fitness, and involves heart-rate monitoring (using a 4-lead electrocardiograph [ECG]; CAM-USB 6.5, Cardiosoft v6.51) during cycle ergometry on a stationary bike (eBike, Firmware v1.7) with a ramp slope that is adapted to the individual based on age, gender, weight and medical history. ECGs were recorded pre-test (15 seconds), during activity (6 minutes) and in recovery (1 minute). The participant's risk category was first calculated to determine what level of activity they should perform or have only a resting ECG performed. The percentage levels of effort during activity were then determined according to their risk category, and their maximum workload was calculated according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex. These measures were introduced to the Assessment Centre towards the end of recruitment. <p> Please note that the ecg/fitness data fields have not yet been summarised into a form suitable for non-specialists and require expert knowledge for analysis. Derived summary variables will be incorporated into the resource when this work is complete.	
100013	Eye measures	0	1	This category contains data on whether both eyes are present and whether they are any contra-indications for the eye measurements, along with a range of measures of eye function, subdivided into categories of: visual acuity, refractive error, intraocular pressure/corneal biomechanics, and optical coherence tomography. These measures were introduced to the Assessment Centre towards the end of recruitment.	
100014	Refractometer 1	0	1	This category contains data on measurements related to the assessment of the participant's eye prescription (refractive error), using a TomeyRC - 5000 device. This category includes data on whether the measurement was made, and the test result for refractometry (Sphere, Cylinder, Axis, Pupil diameter) and keratometry (corneal refraction and astigmatism) for each eye. This measure was added to the assessment visit towards the end of recruitment and continued through the repeat visit in 2012.	
100015	Intraocular pressure	0	1	This category contains data on intraocular pressure, using the Reichert Ocular Response Analyser, which measures the difference in air pressures at which the cornea flattens inwards and outwards using a puff of air. This category includes data on whether the measurement was performed, and data on eye applanation, corneal hysteresis, corneal resistance factor, corneal-resisted intraocular pressure, and an intraocular pressure graph for each eye. This measure was added to the assessment visit towards the end of recruitment.	
100016	Retinal optical coherence tomography	0	1	This category contains data on optical imaging (Coherence Tomography) of the retina. The instrument takes a 3D scan and photograph of the retina and also provides a magnified photograph of the fundus. This category includes data on whether the measurement was performed, and imaging data of each eye. <p> This measure was added to the assessment visit towards the end of recruitment and also carried out during the initial re-assessment phase in 2012 using the TOPCON 3D OCT 1000 Mk2. It was not part of the standard imaging protocol but was re-introduced at the end of 2022 for participants being re-imaged using the TOPCON Triton device.	
100017	Visual acuity	0	1	This category contains data on measurements related to the assessment of visual acuity (includes data on whether the measurement was made, the distance from the viewer to the screen, whether glasses were worn, plain/mirrored view, the letters that were displayed in each round and the log(minimum angle of resolution)result for each eye). This measure was added to the assessment visit towards the end of recruitment. <p> For non-specialists, the primary items of interest are ~F5201~ and ~F5208~.	
100018	Bone-densitometry of heel	0	1	This category contains data on bone mineral density (BMD) based on an ultrasound measurement of the calcaneus, using the Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer. The Sonometer estimates BMD by measuring the speed of sound and broadband ultrasound attenuation. These results are combined to give the Quantitative Ultrasound Index. From this an estimate is made of BMD, and a T-score, which is a person's BMD compared with what is normally expected in a healthy adult of their sex. In the early stages of recruitment only a single foot was used for the measurement (the side being recorded), however in the later stages the measurement was taken on both feet.	
100019	Hand grip strength	0	1	This category contains data on right and left hand isometric grip strength, measured using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer. Calibration records for the dynamometers are available in ~R2431~, ~R2432~ and ~R2433~, with a description in ~R2434~	The hand dynamometers in use at UK Biobank assessment centres were calibrated externally. This resource makes the calibration data available to researchers. <br> Each dynamometer is listed by its UKB_ID, which is the same as the Device ID listed in ~F38~. <br> Records exist from three different calibration companies. The format of the calibration certificates varies with company and over time. Some certificates state only whether the dynamometer passed or failed. Others include records of the pre-adjustment test values at 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 kg. <br> Where pre-adjustment values are recorded, they are formatted in two possible ways. Either a standard input such as 10 kg is applied, and the corresponding reading on the dynamometer dial is recorded, or sufficient input is applied to produce a standard reading such as 10 kg on the dynamometer dial, and the size of the input is recorded. <br><ul> Three different tsv files are therefore provided: <li> ~R2431~ has the records that state only pass or fail or an adjustment comment, with no values. <li> ~R2432~ has the records that use standard input weights. <li> ~R2433~ has the records that use standard readings. </ul> <br> ~R2434~ provides a text description of the calibration data.
100020	Spirometry	0	1	This category contains data on breath spirometry using a Vitalograph Pneumotrac 6800. The participant is asked to record two to three blows (lasting for at least 6 seconds) within a period of about 6 minutes. The computer compares the reproducibility of the first two blows and, if acceptable (defined as a <5% difference in forced volume vital capacity (FVC) & Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1)), will indicate that the third blow is not required. During the pilot phase of the study up to 7 blows were possible.

100026	Cognitive function	0	1	This category contains information on the types of cognitive function tests performed on the touchscreen questionnaire, subdivided into different tests.	
100027	Fluid intelligence / reasoning	0	1	This category contains data on questions designed to assess 'Fluid intelligence' (i.e. the capacity to solve problems that require logic and reasoning ability, independent of acquired knowledge). The participant has 2 minutes to complete as many questions as possible from the test. This test was incorporated into the touchscreen towards the end of recruitment. <p> For non-specialists, the primary item of interest is ~F20016~. <p> This measure was also performed online in ~L118~. <p> For all instances, answer and duration data is provided for all questions up to and including the question being presented at the 2-minute limit. Only questions attempted within the allotted 2-minute limit are included in ~F20016~ and ~F20128~ (the fluid intelligence score and the number of fluid intelligence questions attempted within time limit).	
100028	Lights pattern memory	0	1	This category contains data on a test designed to assess visual short-term memory, as part of the touchscreen questionnaire. The participant is shown a series of pictures of houses which have some windows lit. The participant then has to indicate which windows were lit after a 10-second delay. The data recorded include the number of columns and rows that were lit in each round of the test, the pattern of lights and the pattern of lights as remembered, and the time taken to complete the test. This test was performed in the pilot phase of the study and is available for a subset of participants.	
100029	Numeric memory	0	1	This category contains data on a test designed to assess numeric short-term memory, as part of the touchscreen questionnaire. The participant was shown a 2-digit number to remember. The number then disappeared and after a short while they were asked to enter the number onto the screen. The number became one digit longer each time they remembered correctly (up to a maximum of 12 digits). Data collected include the number of digits and value of the number, the length of time the number was displayed, the time that the participant first entered and last entered a digit, the time taken to complete the test, the value of the number entered by the participant, whether or not the participant was correct, the maximum number of digits remembered, and whether the test was completed. This test is available for a subset of participants. <p> For non-specialists, the primary item of interest is ~F4282~. <p> This measure was also performed online in ~L120~.	
100030	Pairs matching	0	1	This category contains data on 'pairs' matching tests. Participants are asked to memorise the position of as many matching pairs of cards as possible. The cards are then turned face down on the screen and the participant is asked to touch as many pairs as possible in the fewest tries. <p> Multiple rounds were conducted. The first round used 3 pairs of cards and the second 6 pairs of cards. In the pilot phase an additional (i.e. third) round was conducted using 6 pairs of cards, which was subsequently dropped from the main study as it was thought the extra set of results were very similar to the second. However, this decision was reversed by the time of the imaging assessments, so that a third round was presented only if the participant made 2 errors or fewer on the second round. <p>This category includes data on the number of columns (i.e. 3 or 4), number of rows (i.e. 2 or 3) and the number of correct and incorrect matches. For non-specialists, the primary items of interest are ~F399~ and (for the pilot) ~F10137~. <p> This measure was also performed online in ~L117~.	
100031	Prospective memory	0	1	This category contains data on a question designed to assess 'Prospective Memory'. Early in the touchscreen cognitive section, the participant is shown the mesage "At the end of the games we will show you four coloured shapes and ask you to touch the Blue Square. However, to test your memory, we want you to actually touch the Orange Circle instead." This category includes data on the first and final answer, the history of attempts and the time it took to answer.	
100032	Reaction time	0	1	This category contains data on a test to assess reaction time and is based on 12 rounds of the card-game 'Snap'. The participant is shown two cards at a time; if both cards are the same, they press a button-box that is on the table in front of them as quickly as possible. For each of the 12 rounds, the following data were collected: the pictures shown on the cards (Index of card A, Index of card B), the number of times the participant clicked the 'snap' button, and the time it took to first click the 'snap' button. <p> This was followed-up in web-based ~L119~.	
100033	Early life factors	0	1	This category contains data from the touchscreen questionnaire on questions related to early life exposures (area of birth, adoption, multiple birth, maternal smoking at birth, whether breastfed, handedness, and childhood body size).	
100034	Family history	0	1	This category contains data from the touchscreen questionnaire on questions related to family size, sibling order, family medical history (of parents and siblings) and age of parents (age of death if died).

It includes data on type of operation (grouped by body region, and presented in a tree structure), the number of operations, and date of each one. <br> The interviewer was made aware, via a pop-up box on their computer screen, if the participant had answered in the touchscreen that they had a history of a major operation, and was prompted to ask "Could you now tell me what the operation was?" For example, if a woman had indicated in the touchscreen that they had had a hysterectomy or bilateral oopherectomy, this would already have been selected in the operation tree. If during the interview it appeared these had been incorrectly selected, the interviewer could alter the responses. If the participant stated in the touchscreen they had no history of major operations (or were not sure), this question was asked again and confirmed by the interviewer. <br> Operations that could not be coded at the time of the interview were entered as free text, and subsequently coded wherever possible.

100092	Cancer register	0	1	This category contains coded data on cancer incidence (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]), obtained through linkage to national cancer registries. <p> National cancer registries centralise information received from separate regional cancer centres around the UK. The completeness of follow-up can vary between cancer registries and this should be considered in analyses when determining dates of complete follow-up for censoring purposes. Because data is continually accruing, please be aware that the follow-up time and number of cases presented in the Health Outcomes report may vary from the data sent out to researchers. <p> While we have attempted to provide meanings for all codes supplied here, there has been no detailed data cleaning. For example, there are a small number of participants with apparent duplicate data (i.e. diagnosed with the same cancer type on the same date, or shortly thereafter) and we have made no attempt to remove these (or any other oddities from the data). The Cancer Outcomes Working Group is preparing a more refined dataset for cancer outcomes, which will be available in due course. <p> Researchers should review ~R115558~ for more information on anomalies in the cancer registry data. <br> <p><i>Researcher publications should use the following citation where data from NHS England has been used: "This work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of their care and support."</i>	Information on the number of prevalent and incident cancer cases present in the UK Biobank cohort is provided in the following reports: <br> <br> 1. <b>Cancer Summary Report</b> presents summary statistics on the most common malignant cancer diagnoses within the UK Biobank cohort (excluding benign, non-malignant and unspecified cancers).

100115	UK Biobank Urban Morphometric Platform	0	1	<p>This category contains data obtained from a morphometric analysis of the built environment that was conducted by the Cochrane Institute of Primary Care and Public Health, Cardiff University. The aim of this project was to create an objective assessment of the built environment within the immediate residential neighbourhood of UK Biobank participants. Since January 2017, Built Environment metrics are available for participants from all assessment centres. <p>The available metrics include: <ul> <li>Building class</li> <li>Destination accessibility</li> <li>Greenness</li> <li>Land use density</li> <li>Street network accessibility</li> <li>Terrain (slope)</li> <li>Accessibility foodscapes (London area only)</li> </ul>	The aim of the UK Biobank Built Environment project was the objective assessment of the built environment (OABE) around the immediate neighbourhood of 500,000 participants of the UK Biobank cohort. <p>This resulted in the modelling, compilation and linkage of corresponding longitudinal spatial database of built environment with the UK Biobank health datasets. The large-scale automation of such detailed and precise measures of individual-level built environment morphological metrics (morphometrics) has the potential to unravel the black box of causality, the pathways through which built environment in conjunction with the social and natural environment act as one of fundamental determinants of individual behaviour, physical and mental health. <p>OABE of UK Biobank can thus produce a comprehensive evidence-base on the impact of BE on lifestyle, behaviour and thereby health and hence, guide preventive intervention strategies as well as policy formulation.

It is anticipated that whole genome sequencing data for the full cohort will become available before the end of 2023.
100315	Genotype Results	0	1	Genotype calls (based on genotyping array measurements) and related measurements. The genotypes are aligned to the + strand of the reference and positions are in GRCh37 coordinates. <p> The fields listed here are indicators and adding them to an Application basket will allow researchers to download the corresponding underlying information from the UKB repository. This information includes <ul> <li>Calls (0.1TB)</li> <li>Confidences (2.9TB)</li> <li>Intensities (2.9TB)</li> <li>CNV B-allele frequencies (1.5TB)</li> <li>CNV log2ratios (2.3TB)</li> </ul> <p> Marker quality control (QC) and Sample QC information, including population structure (see Relatedness in the Notes below) is also available. Intensity and SNP posteriors are available for cluster plotting. B-allele frequency and log2ratio are available for CNV analysis. <p>The lists of SNPs in the Genotype datasets can be downloaded from the Field's Resources tabs on a per-chromosome basis or as a combined tar in ~R1963~. <p> Researchers who want only a few specific genotyped SNPs (rather than the whole-chromosome datasets below) may, once logged in, request them either by identiyfing them individually using the Genomics Search function or by entering their Affy IDs directly using the List Actions tab of the Basket screen. <p> See ~R530~ for additional information, including a citable reference for publications.	The genotype <b>Calls</b> are in binary PLINK format (.bed, .bim, .fam) see https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats for details of the formats. The BIM file determines the order of markers in the calls and all of the other genotype data sets. The SNP_id is the rsid where it is available or the Affymetrix_SNP_id otherwise. The positions are in GRCh37 coordinates. The FAM file determines the order of samples in the calls and all of the other genotype data sets. The FAM file includes 'Batch' in the Phenotype field (6th column). <p> The <b>Confidence</b> files contain the Affymetrix 'confidence' that a genotype belongs to the call cluster. This is a plaintext file with space separated columns. Values are in the range 0-1 with 0 being most confident. Missing values are represented by -1. The order of markers and Samples are given by the BIM and FAM files. <p> The <b>CNV</b> files contain the B-Allele-Frequency (baf) and Log2Ratio (log2r) transformed intensity values for performing CNV calling. There is a separate file for baf and log2r per chromosome. These are plaintext files with space separated columns. The rows correspond to markers (ordered as the calls BIM file) and the columns correspond to samples (ordered as the calls FAM file) Missing values are represented by -1. <p> The <b>Intensity</b> files contains the A,B intensity data measured by Affymetrix. The files are in a simple custom binary format. There are two intensity values A,B for each genotype, each represented as a 4-byte float. The set of A,B values for each marker are ordered consecutively by sample (analagous to a matrix with rows=SNPs and columns=Samples) e.g. SNP_1_SAMPLE_1_A SNP_1_SAMPLE_1_B SNP_1_SAMPLE_2_A SNP_1_SAMPLE_2_B ... SNP_1_SAMPLE_N_A SNP_1_SAMPLE_N_B SNP_2_SAMPLE_1_A SNP_2_SAMPLE_1_B ... Missing pairs of intensities are represented by -1 -1. The order of the markers and Samples are given by the BIM and FAM files with the calls. <br> Affymetrix transform the A,B values into 'contrast' and 'strength' for their calling algorithm. If the intensity data is to be used for making cluster plots it is strongly suggested that the transformed values are plotted. The ellipses described by the snp-posterior data are only compatible with the transformed intensity values. <ul> <li>contrast (X) = log2(A/B)</li> <li>strength (Y) = log2(AB)/2</li> </ul> Affymetrix called the genotypes in (106) batches of ~4,700 samples. To accurately examine the cluster plots, each batch should be plotted separately for a given marker. For chrX, males and females were called separately, so males and females should be plotted separately for chrX markers. Evoker (https://github.com/wtsi-medical-genomics/evoker) can be used to plot cluster plots, following the recommendations above, for the UK Biobank data. <p> The <b>Relatedness</b> of individuals is obtained using the gfetch utility (~R668~) which generates a plaintext file with 5 space-separated columns: <ol> <li>ID for participant 1 in related pair;</li> <li>ID for participant 2 in related pair;</li> <li>HetHet : fraction of markers for which the pair both have a heterozygous genotype;</li> <li>IBS0 : fraction of markers for which the pair shares zero alleles;</li> <li>Estimate of the kinship coefficient for this pair based on the set of markers used in the kinship inference;</li> </ol> where the HetHet, IBS0 and Kinship values were generated by the KING software.
100316	Genotype confidences	0	1	Genotype probabilities associated with genotyping array measurement calls. <p> The UKB download format uses 2-bytes to store each person/snp Confidence value. <p>NOTE: the fields here relate to the Initial 150K person release and are now obsolete. They may no longer be added to Application baskets.	The Confidence value stored is the estimated probability that a given Call is incorrect, hence a value of 0.1 means that the Call is believed to have a 90% probability of being accurate. Confidences above 0.15 (i.e. below 85% certainty) were regarded as indicating unreliable results and the corresponding Calls marked as unknown/indeterminate.
100317	Genotyping intensities	0	1	Genotyping intensities used in genotyping array measurements. <p> The UKB download format uses 8-bytes to store each person/snp Intensity value. <p>NOTE: the fields here relate to the Initial 150K person release and are now obsolete. They may no longer be added to Application baskets.	
100319	Imputation	0	1	Imputed genotype and phased haplotype values. Genotypes were imputed into the dataset using computationally efficient methods combined with the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) and UK10K haplotype resource. This increased the number of testable variants over 100-fold to ~96 million variants, which are stored in the compressed and indexed BGENv1.2 format. The imputed genotypes are aligned to the + strand of the reference and the positions are in GRCh37 coordinates. <p> The fields listed here are indicators and adding them to an Application basket will allow researchers to download the corresponding underlying information from the UKB repository. This information includes <ul> <li>Imputation (2.6TB)</li> <li>Haplotypes (0.06TB)</li> </ul> <p> The lists of SNPs in the imputed datasets can be downloaded from the Field's Resources tabs on a per-chromosome basis or as a combined tars in ~R1965~ and ~R1671~. The information scores and minor allele frequency data for the imputed genotypes (computed with QCTOOL) can also be downloaded in ~R1967~. <p>Questions about using the imputed genotypes can be directed to a special UK Biobank mailing list, which can be joined at ~Ehttps://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=UKB-GENETICS~. <p> See ~R530~ for additional information (such as the quality control) including a citable reference for publications. <p> Please note: there was a problem with version 2 of the UK Biobank imputed data identified in 2017. Please ensure you are using version 3 of the imputed data, which was first released in 2018. Version 2 of the non-imputed data continues to be correct and current. <p>The problem with version 2 of the imputed data was as follows: <i> <p> The genetic data was imputed using two different reference panels. The Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panel was used wherever possible, but for SNPs not in that reference panel the UK10K + 1000 Genomes panel was used. The problem arose in the second set of imputed data from the UK10K + 1000 Genomes panel. The genotypes at these SNPs were imputed correctly, but they were not recorded as having the correct genome position in the files. <p> The imputed data from the HRC panel was not affected and had the correct positions. This was about ~40M sites and included the majority of the common SNPs i.e. sites most likely to show genetic associations. These sites could be identified using the publicly available HRC site list at ~Ehttp://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/site~. </i>	The <b>Imputed</b> genotype calls are in BGEN v1.2 format (.bgen, .sample, .bgi) see ~R12~ for details of the formats. The sample file lists the order of the samples in the .bgen files. The list of variants in the files can be found with bgenix (https://bitbucket.org/gavinband/bgen/wiki/bgenix). The 1st column of the marker list file is 'alternate_ids' which is a unique identifier for each marker. For markers in the genotype data set 'alternate_ids' is the genotype marker id (rs_id in SNP-QC file). The second column is rsid or the reference panel marker_id, it is not guaranteed to be unique. The alleles in the imputation are aligned with REF/ALT, first_allele is the ref allele on the fwd strand. <p> <p> The phased <b>Haplotypes</b> are in BGEN v1.2 format (.bgen, .sample, .bgi) see ~R12~ for details of the formats. The sample file lists the order of the samples in the .bgen files.
199001	Interim genotype release	0	1	This category groups together data fields which were relevant to the initial genotype data release (150K people) but became obsolete when the main genotyping results (488K people) were released in 2017. The fields here are presented for reference only and may not be selected for download. The various Resource materials should be regarded as obsolete as, generally, they were superceded or invalidated when the main genotyping results were release.
